Really thanks for Youtube Channel Bo Qian again.
This roadmap is noted based on the channel overview video.
As the video series updated, the difficulty of cpp knowledge gradually increases. As least for me, it is hard to follow the whole series quickily.
So I take this note to remind myself the sequence of the study roadmap.

1. Advanced C++ (from old to new C++ standard)(all are important, except the last three about memery management if you dont need)
2. Modern C++ ( language features and library of 11 and 14)
3. C++ Standard Library (introduce STL before C++11)(first round could skip #1#2 stream)
4. Anything you like
